<td><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</p><p>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s</p><p>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</p><p>Let's make it possible for hardworking <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s to save for retirement</p><p>It's time to admit that no amount of <strong>AMERICAN</strong> lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</p><p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one <strong>AMERICAN</strong> family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</p><p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> promise has been threatened once more</p><p>Tonight, more <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s are out of work and more are working harder for less</p><p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major <strong>AMERICAN</strong> city drowns before our eyes</p><p>Tonight, I say to the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!, This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</p><p>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners.", These are the Americans that I know</p><p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s</p><p>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s?, We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</p><p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create <strong>AMERICAN</strong> jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</p><p>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every <strong>AMERICAN</strong> who's willing to work</p><p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> workers and small businesses who deserve it</p><p>I'll make it easier for the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people to afford these new cars</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young <strong>AMERICAN</strong> - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</p><p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single <strong>AMERICAN</strong></p><p>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</p><p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts <strong>AMERICAN</strong> wages by hiring illegal workers</p><p>Change happens because the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</p><p>Instead, it is that <strong>AMERICAN</strong> spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</p><p>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</p><p>Let us keep that promise - that <strong>AMERICAN</strong> promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</p><p>These are <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</p><p>These are <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</p><p>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s who refused</p><p>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> Dream</p><p><strong>AMERICAN</strong>s know this</p><p>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every <strong>AMERICAN</strong> an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</p><p>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s</p><p>The party that won't make <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people about why we are there and how we will win</p><p>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an <strong>AMERICAN</strong> agenda</p><p>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s</p><p><strong>AMERICAN</strong>s everywhere are desperate for leadership</p><p>Our time to write a new chapter in the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> story</p><p>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in <strong>AMERICAN</strong> history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</p><p>Throughout <strong>AMERICAN</strong> history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people ?, A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</p><p><strong>AMERICAN</strong>s were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over</p><p>the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?, 2,867 Americans have now died in this war</p><p>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before <strong>AMERICAN</strong> troops arrived</p><p>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?, When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil</p><p>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet <strong>AMERICAN</strong> troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier</p><p>The addition of 4,000 <strong>AMERICAN</strong> troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city</p><p>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on <strong>AMERICAN</strong> soldiers</p><p>“rejected the notion of an <strong>AMERICAN</strong> ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”, And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve</p><p>The <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people have been extraordinarily resolved</p><p>It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding <strong>AMERICAN</strong> forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own</p><p>The <strong>AMERICAN</strong> soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question</p><p>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put <strong>AMERICAN</strong> troops in danger</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and <strong>AMERICAN</strong> enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists</p><p>But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in <strong>AMERICAN</strong> history</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the <strong>AMERICAN</strong> people</p><p>According to a Pew survey, 42% of <strong>AMERICAN</strong>s now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”, Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago</p><p>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at <strong>AMERICAN</strong> University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.</p></td>

<td><p>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> can be</p><p>And we should take heart, because we've changed this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> before</p><p>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their <strong>COUNTRY</strong> can change it</p><p>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this <strong>COUNTRY</strong>'s middle-class again</p><p>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our <strong>COUNTRY</strong> safe</p><p>All of us running for president will travel around the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</p><p>We are a better <strong>COUNTRY</strong> than this</p><p>This <strong>COUNTRY</strong> is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</p><p>This <strong>COUNTRY</strong> is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</p><p>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> for a third</p><p>And we are here because we love this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</p><p>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our <strong>COUNTRY</strong> with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</p><p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</p><p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> with the help of student loans and scholarships</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, we will make sure you can afford a college education</p><p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</p><p>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>I love this <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, and so do you, and so does John McCain</p><p>We all put our <strong>COUNTRY</strong> first</p><p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>This <strong>COUNTRY</strong> of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:, I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</p><p>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>I think he loves his <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>The idea that everybody has a stake in the <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</p><p>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> is about</p><p>Will she see a <strong>COUNTRY</strong> that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?, Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?, We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</p><p>Our time to leave our children a <strong>COUNTRY</strong> that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</p><p>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> for many, many years</p><p>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</p><p>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own <strong>COUNTRY</strong> that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</p><p>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of people in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> desperately want to change this</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a <strong>COUNTRY</strong> truly committed to reform could start</p><p>Instead of unifying the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</p><p>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your <strong>COUNTRY</strong> has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</p><p>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, a great future</p><p>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their <strong>COUNTRY</strong> that will last longer than their own lives</p><p>And you will determine the direction of this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</p><p>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>These are serious times for our <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?, A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own <strong>COUNTRY</strong> are coming to an end</p><p>to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the <strong>COUNTRY</strong> and bring this conflict under control</p><p>For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this <strong>COUNTRY</strong> indefinitely ?, Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the <strong>COUNTRY</strong></p><p>Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution</p><p>We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions</p><p>and within their own countries</p><p>if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken</p><p>The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a <strong>COUNTRY</strong> through military force</p><p>According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”, We cannot afford to be a <strong>COUNTRY</strong> of isolationists right now</p><p>But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?, It is time to give Iraqis their country back</p><p>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.</p></td>

that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</p><p>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised;

whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</p><p>I'll make it easier for the American <strong>PEOPLE</strong> to afford these new cars</p><p>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that <strong>PEOPLE</strong> cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</p><p>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone <strong>PEOPLE</strong> should run from</p><p>Change happens because the American <strong>PEOPLE</strong> demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</p><p>In the young <strong>PEOPLE</strong> who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</p><p>But what the <strong>PEOPLE</strong> heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear <strong>PEOPLE</strong> express the same anxiety about the future;

the story of <strong>PEOPLE</strong> fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</p><p>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous <strong>PEOPLE</strong>s, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</p><p>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the <strong>PEOPLE</strong> of this great continent</p><p>One that serves its <strong>PEOPLE</strong> and is free from corruption</p><p>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest <strong>PEOPLE</strong> of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of <strong>PEOPLE</strong> in this country desperately want to change this</p><p>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that <strong>PEOPLE</strong> feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</p><p>In the end, if the <strong>PEOPLE</strong> cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</p><p>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among <strong>PEOPLE</strong> and politicians that this is a critical issue</p><p>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its <strong>PEOPLE</strong></p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan <strong>PEOPLE</strong> want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</p><p>The Kenyan <strong>PEOPLE</strong> are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</p><p>And we also know that the more <strong>PEOPLE</strong> there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</p><p>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, <strong>PEOPLE</strong> come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</p><p>When <strong>PEOPLE</strong> are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the <strong>PEOPLE</strong>, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</p><p>The Kenyan <strong>PEOPLE</strong> are the ultimate guardians against abuses</p><p>Looking out at this crowd of young <strong>PEOPLE</strong>, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</p><p>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of <strong>PEOPLE</strong> in his lifetime</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American <strong>PEOPLE</strong> ?, A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American <strong>PEOPLE</strong> have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over</p><p>the American <strong>PEOPLE</strong> have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?, The American people have been extraordinarily resolved</p><p>The President should announce to the Iraqi <strong>PEOPLE</strong> that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi <strong>PEOPLE</strong> or stabilize the country</p><p>do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a <strong>PEOPLE</strong> is ensured as well</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American <strong>PEOPLE</strong></p><p>Now, few <strong>PEOPLE</strong> understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</p><p>Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- <strong>PEOPLE</strong> like Col.

<td><p>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in <strong>IRAQ</strong> mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</p><p>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from <strong>IRAQ</strong> and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</p><p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to <strong>IRAQ</strong> just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from <strong>IRAQ</strong> has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</p><p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>I will end this war in <strong>IRAQ</strong> responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</p><p>We've seen our children leave for <strong>IRAQ</strong> and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</p><p>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in <strong>IRAQ</strong>, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p><strong>IRAQ</strong> is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in <strong>IRAQ</strong> to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America</p><p>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in <strong>IRAQ</strong> ?, The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy</p><p>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in <strong>IRAQ</strong> would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences</p><p>Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in <strong>IRAQ</strong>, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working</p><p>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan <strong>IRAQ</strong> Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control</p><p>“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent <strong>IRAQ</strong>i political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”, This is now the reality of Iraq</p><p>Now, I am hopeful that the <strong>IRAQ</strong> Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus</p><p>And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in <strong>IRAQ</strong>, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security</p><p>What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to <strong>IRAQ</strong>’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same</p><p>It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>namely, preventing <strong>IRAQ</strong> from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home</p><p>There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>The American soldiers I met when I traveled to <strong>IRAQ</strong> this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question</p><p>They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>I have long said that the only solution in <strong>IRAQ</strong> is a political one</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in <strong>IRAQ</strong> that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end</p><p>a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from <strong>IRAQ</strong> on a timetable that would begin in four to six months</p><p>that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in <strong>IRAQ</strong> reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels</p><p>Drawing down our troops in <strong>IRAQ</strong> will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force</p><p>This force could help prevent the conflict in <strong>IRAQ</strong> from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region</p><p>The President’s decision to go to war in <strong>IRAQ</strong> has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control</p><p>By redeploying from <strong>IRAQ</strong> to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in <strong>IRAQ</strong> should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists</p><p>In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in <strong>IRAQ</strong> for a more extended period of time</p><p>We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in <strong>IRAQ</strong>, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society</p><p>any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in <strong>IRAQ</strong> to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing</p><p>The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in <strong>IRAQ</strong> with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement</p><p>So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of <strong>IRAQ</strong>, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution</p><p>But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in <strong>IRAQ</strong> filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?, The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution</p><p>if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use <strong>IRAQ</strong> as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken</p><p>As we change strategy in <strong>IRAQ</strong>, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism</p><p>Many who supported the original decision to go to war in <strong>IRAQ</strong> have argued that it has been a failure of implementation</p><p>Much has been written about how the military invasion of <strong>IRAQ</strong> was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell</p><p>threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in <strong>IRAQ</strong></p><p>The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in <strong>IRAQ</strong> than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism</p><p>The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in <strong>IRAQ</strong> has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world</p><p>There is one other place where our mistakes in <strong>IRAQ</strong> have cost us dearly ?, But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?, I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today</p><p>The time for waiting in <strong>IRAQ</strong> is over.</p></td>

that a <strong>WAR</strong> in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences</p><p>Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this <strong>WAR</strong>’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation</p><p>When I came here and gave a speech on this <strong>WAR</strong> a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil</p><p>And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided <strong>WAR</strong></p><p>For the fact is that there are no good options left in this <strong>WAR</strong></p><p>And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this <strong>WAR</strong> is simply a matter of American resolve</p><p>And, while some have proposed escalating this <strong>WAR</strong> by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either</p><p>Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil <strong>WAR</strong></p><p>But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this <strong>WAR</strong></p><p>This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider <strong>WAR</strong>, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region</p><p>The President’s decision to go to <strong>WAR</strong> in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control</p><p>This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this <strong>WAR</strong></p><p>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil <strong>WAR</strong>, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution</p><p>Many who supported the original decision to go to <strong>WAR</strong> in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation</p><p>that the rationale behind the <strong>WAR</strong> itself was misguided</p><p>The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for <strong>WAR</strong>; you must also plan for success</p><p>The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the <strong>WAR</strong> is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism</p><p>Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold <strong>WAR</strong></p><p>Throughout the Cold <strong>WAR</strong>, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.</p></td>

that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the <strong>JOB</strong> in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences</p><p>Prime Minister Maliki is not making our <strong>JOB</strong> easier</p><p>But this is one story that shows our <strong>JOB</strong> is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</p><p>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the <strong>JOB</strong> we started.</p></td>

<td><p>Letting the <strong>IRAQI</strong>s know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the <strong>IRAQI</strong> government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</p><p>We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the <strong>IRAQI</strong>s stand up, we will be able to stand down</p><p>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from <strong>IRAQI</strong> soil</p><p>Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 <strong>IRAQI</strong>s have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February</p><p>300,000 <strong>IRAQI</strong> security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier</p><p>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all <strong>IRAQI</strong>s now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers</p><p>“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent <strong>IRAQI</strong> political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”, It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own</p><p>Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the <strong>IRAQI</strong>s, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war</p><p>to pressure the <strong>IRAQI</strong> leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control</p><p>The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the <strong>IRAQI</strong> government ?, For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?, The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces</p><p>When possible, this should be done in consultation with the <strong>IRAQI</strong> government ?, but it should not depend on Iraqi approval</p><p>But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among <strong>IRAQI</strong> factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?, We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society</p><p>The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the <strong>IRAQI</strong> security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?, who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers</p><p>An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of <strong>IRAQI</strong> units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents</p><p>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified <strong>IRAQI</strong> government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing</p><p>Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the <strong>IRAQI</strong> government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police</p><p>We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the <strong>IRAQI</strong> government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government</p><p>Today, the <strong>IRAQI</strong> landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country</p><p>We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put <strong>IRAQI</strong>s to work and help our troops stabilize key areas</p><p>But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of <strong>IRAQI</strong>s to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement</p><p>And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the <strong>IRAQI</strong>s, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others</p><p>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various <strong>IRAQI</strong> factions towards a political solution</p><p>It is time to give <strong>IRAQI</strong>s their country back.</p></td>

a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</p><p>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative <strong>THREAT</strong> Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</p><p>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this <strong>THREAT</strong> in the days and years to come?, First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</p><p>Yet, a serious <strong>THREAT</strong> still remains</p><p>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation <strong>THREAT</strong> they pose</p><p>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons <strong>THREAT</strong> reduction programs</p><p>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative <strong>THREAT</strong> Reduction program</p><p>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation <strong>THREAT</strong></p><p>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism <strong>THREAT</strong>s</p><p>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the <strong>THREAT</strong></p><p>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological <strong>THREAT</strong>s</p><p>But when we think about the <strong>THREAT</strong> that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</p><p>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative <strong>THREAT</strong> Reduction effort</p><p>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative <strong>THREAT</strong> Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</p><p>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological <strong>THREAT</strong> reduction</p><p>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about <strong>THREAT</strong>s posed by the Soviet Union.</p></td>

<td><p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from <strong>KENYA</strong> and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</p><p>And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from <strong>KENYA</strong></p><p>The first time I came to <strong>KENYA</strong> was in 1987</p><p>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of <strong>KENYA</strong> possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</p><p>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of <strong>KENYA</strong>'s liberation struggles</p><p>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to <strong>KENYA</strong></p><p>His ideas about how <strong>KENYA</strong> should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</p><p>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of <strong>KENYA</strong>, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</p><p>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither <strong>KENYA</strong> nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</p><p>In early 1960's, as <strong>KENYA</strong> was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</p><p>Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than <strong>KENYA</strong>'s</p><p><strong>KENYA</strong>, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances</p><p><strong>KENYA</strong> was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</p><p>Third, <strong>KENYA</strong> is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</p><p>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with <strong>KENYA</strong> and with Africa</p><p>But, <strong>KENYA</strong> must do its part</p><p>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if <strong>KENYA</strong> does not act, it will fall behind</p><p>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why <strong>KENYA</strong> lags behind</p><p>Like many nations across this continent, where <strong>KENYA</strong> is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</p><p>Among African nations, <strong>KENYA</strong> remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</p><p>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in <strong>KENYA</strong> it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</p><p>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in <strong>KENYA</strong> costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</p><p>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in <strong>KENYA</strong></p><p>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened <strong>KENYA</strong></p><p>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger <strong>KENYA</strong> where everyone rises together</p><p>This is the <strong>KENYA</strong> that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</p><p>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to <strong>KENYA</strong> from America when I was still young</p><p>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in <strong>KENYA</strong> on my last trip to this country</p><p>In today's <strong>KENYA</strong> - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.</p></td>

that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences</p><p>We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of <strong>WEAPON</strong>s of mass destruction</p><p>and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining <strong>WEAPON</strong>s of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations</p><p>And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear <strong>WEAPON</strong>s terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way</p><p>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous <strong>WEAPON</strong>s, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</p><p>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological <strong>WEAPON</strong>s program</p><p>Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest <strong>WEAPON</strong>s that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</p><p>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these <strong>WEAPON</strong>s has never been greater</p><p>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing <strong>WEAPON</strong>s of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</p><p>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet <strong>WEAPON</strong>s scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</p><p>Some <strong>WEAPON</strong>s experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</p><p>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological <strong>WEAPON</strong>s within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</p><p>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear <strong>WEAPON</strong>s - serves as a model of how we can do this</p><p>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear <strong>WEAPON</strong></p><p>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a <strong>WEAPON</strong> of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</p><p>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear <strong>WEAPON</strong>s and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</p><p>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological <strong>WEAPON</strong>s threat reduction programs</p><p>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological <strong>WEAPON</strong>s program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</p><p>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical <strong>WEAPON</strong>s</p><p>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional <strong>WEAPON</strong>s, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</p><p>In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional <strong>WEAPON</strong>s that were slowly being dismantled</p><p>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these <strong>WEAPON</strong>s</p><p>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these <strong>WEAPON</strong>s to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</p><p>But when we think about the threat that these <strong>WEAPON</strong>s pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</p><p>We must safeguard these dangerous <strong>WEAPON</strong>s, material, and expertise.</p></td>

<td><p>America, it's time to start bringing our <strong>TROOP</strong>s home</p><p>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more <strong>TROOP</strong>s to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our <strong>TROOP</strong>s from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</p><p>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our <strong>TROOP</strong>s into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</p><p>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our <strong>TROOP</strong>s and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</p><p>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American <strong>TROOP</strong>s arrived</p><p>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American <strong>TROOP</strong>s from Iraqi soil</p><p>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American <strong>TROOP</strong> levels have not been reduced by a single soldier</p><p>The addition of 4,000 American <strong>TROOP</strong>s in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city</p><p>namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our <strong>TROOP</strong>s can come home</p><p>And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more <strong>TROOP</strong>s, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either</p><p>It’s not clear that these <strong>TROOP</strong> levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own</p><p>Our <strong>TROOP</strong>s can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes</p><p>And all the <strong>TROOP</strong>s in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace</p><p>a phased redeployment of U.S. <strong>TROOP</strong>s from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months</p><p>We cannot compromise the safety of our <strong>TROOP</strong>s, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground</p><p>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain <strong>TROOP</strong> levels</p><p>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American <strong>TROOP</strong>s in danger</p><p>Drawing down our <strong>TROOP</strong>s in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force</p><p>This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our <strong>TROOP</strong>s to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, some of these <strong>TROOP</strong>s could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there</p><p>By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more <strong>TROOP</strong>s and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. <strong>TROOP</strong>s remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists</p><p>We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our <strong>TROOP</strong>s stabilize key areas</p><p>If we commit our <strong>TROOP</strong>s anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home</p><p>The overwhelming presence of our <strong>TROOP</strong>s, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world</p><p>Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. <strong>TROOP</strong>s.</p></td>
